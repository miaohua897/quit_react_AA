        info:'The cell is the basic structural and functional unit of all living organisms. It is the smallest unit of life capable of performing all the necessary functions for survival, such as metabolism, energy production, and reproduction. Cells can exist as single-celled organisms, like bacteria, or form complex multicellular organisms, such as plants and animals. There are two main types of cells: prokaryotic cells, which lack a nucleus, and eukaryotic cells, which have a defined nucleus and other specialized organelles. The study of cells is fundamental to understanding biology, health, and disease.'
